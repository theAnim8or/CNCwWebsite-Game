    <p><mark>Welcome to AssetAssist, this site was created to give access to the bare necessities of
        designing and creating 3D assets, as well as offer a place for support and links to specified communities. 



        Don't know what an asset is when it comes to animation and graphic design??
        We have a page just for you!! But lets get the basics out of the way. Assets are anything you 
        or someone else has created using design software.
        
        This can range from objects, creatures and terrain to whole worlds. Assets are your best friend, they make the repetative side of the job a little less stressful and you can have some real fun creating and animating your own.

Located on our site are the links to some of the best free software available and many assets for you to dig in and experiment with. We suggest using blender* as it has the easiest layout and rounded capabilites. Basically you can do everything on here, whereas for engines like Unity, you need another piece of software to create assets.


<br>
We also have reviews from various communities on the different software and a focus for which is better for the different animation styles and project types.


<br>

Assets are used in many capacities, from archtectural to cartoon animations. with the right software and experience (and no we don't mean a degree or anything
of the like.) All you need is a PC or Laptop (some programs even run from
<br> your mobile devices) and patience. 
<br><br>
<br> It takes time and effort to succeed in design of any kind,
<br> so dont feel disheartened if your projects arent advancing 
<br>as fast as you would like.



<br>
<br>
Each of the images located on this page contain links to the software developers main sites and asset stores (the free bits). We have a page set up where you can access free assets made by us and sourced from other creators (easier than traversing loads of differnt sites).
we also included links to the official sites in the Download Centre, here you can access all the relevant software you need and even get suggestions for the types of software you should be using for your projects.

<div id="tipsTricks" class="txtSty">
    <p>Three Useful Tips and Tricks:
        A little help and a few shortcuts to make your life a little easier.
<br><br>
        1) Struggling for inspiration? Have a peek at someone elses assets and experiment with them, you may learn
        something new or discover an easier way of using the software you choose.
<br><br>
        2) Even the best animators get stuck now and again or have off days, even weeks and months. Keep working and try stimulating your brain 
        by watching tutorials (links:)
<br><br>
        3)Use the forums (like the one on the right of the page) they more than often have someone who will be able to help you, 
        some of your questions might even have already been asked/answered!!
<br><br>
        You are the master of your creativity! Find what stimulates your creative side and get yourself some!!
        Personally I like to go for a brisk walk to clear my head, it works...even when its terrible weather, although we dont recommend
        traversing the wilds or braving a storm (unless thats your thing)
